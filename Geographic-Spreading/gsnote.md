# Georgraphic Spreading Project

## Initial Questions

1. What are the conditions/assumptions necessary for use?

2. How is the SIR model adjusted to incorporate the spacial component? (PDE?)

3. For our application, what do we care about?

4. What are the limitations of this approach?

## Notes/Ideas

Is a baseline model required? Comparing to data for simulations - is data reliable/continuous?

How to incorporate localized immunity?

Continuous vs disccrete models... when is the later useful?

What is kernel-modulated, how is it useful? What other kinds of transforms/fancy math are out there and are there any worth exploring to incorporate renewal equation project?
