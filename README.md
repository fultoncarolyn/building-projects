# Initializing project work space divided into three different projects we're investigating
Corresponding code and notes of project status can be found in the folder of each

Project 1 -> Renewal Equations for Individual and/or Population Infectiousness

Project 2 -> Geographic Spreading Wave-Like Phenom (Not Cultural Center Spread)

Project 3 -> Developing Robust Supply Chain Networks for Impacts of Infectious Disease

Will likely make new repos once projects grow, so this is just initial exploring stages (scratch) space
