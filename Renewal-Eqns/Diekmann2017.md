# Diekmann 2017 - Renewal Equations Application

## Notes

**Goals:** Describe distribution of immunity status incorporating waning and boosting determines by continuous contacts with the virus. Derivation of a linear renewal equation via force of infection.

**(a)** Can we compute the distribution of an individualâ€™s immune status at age $a$, given that it starts life with an immune level $y_b$?

**(b)** Will the distribution of immune status converge to a stable distribution? (the stable distribution will describe the distribution of immunity in a population in steady state, if everybody is born with immune status $y_b$)


Model (Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process)ingredients are $g(y)$ - decline since contact with virus, $\Lambda$ - rate of contacts with virus which is the only randomness introduced, $f(y)$ - boosting map

Is this a vector space or a function space?

## Questions

1. How do we make our assumptions? How do they influence the derivation? What type of assumptions are worth exploring? Why immortality? Some are intuitive and pronlem relavant but some arent...

2. Instantaneous boosting map -> read De Graaf 2014

3. Described relationships of distributions and convergence requirements. Why do we care about that?
