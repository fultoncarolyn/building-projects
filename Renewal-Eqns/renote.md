# Renewal Equations for Infectiousness Project

## Initial Questions

1. What domain/restrictions pertain to these functions? Is that something to really care about?

2. Does this structure require fitting to data or is it more of a theoretical approach (randomized delta)?

3. What are the limitations of this approach?

4. Are we going against the grain by doing this or are there suspicions out there about the common approach?

## Notes/Ideas

How does this relate to stochastic processes? I am seeing that a lot...

What assumptions about the data/model do we need to make for this to work? ex Independt Identically Distributed

How is this different from renewal theory in stats?

How does it relate to the reproduction number? Is that relevant/something we care to explore? <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0429>

Heterogeniety vs homogeneity chages how this is used? When would we ever use the later?

When is the lower bound of our intergral $-\infty$ vs 0?

How can we produce the force of infection/what type of metrics do we care about? Individual infectiveness over time, vs age of population, etc

Is overfitting an issue? How do we check for accuracy?
